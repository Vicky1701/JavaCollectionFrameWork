List Interface in Java
The List interface is part of the java.util package and represents an ordered collection of elements. It allows duplicate elements and provides positional access to elements (via indices).

Key Methods in List
add(E e): Adds an element to the end of the list.

add(int index, E e): Inserts an element at the specified index.

get(int index): Returns the element at the specified index.

remove(int index): Removes the element at the specified index.

set(int index, E e): Replaces the element at the specified index.

size(): Returns the number of elements in the list.

List Implementations
1. ArrayList
Dynamic Array: Resizable array implementation of the List interface.

Underlying Data Structure: Array.

Best Use Case: When frequent access to elements by index is required.

Key Features
Fast random access (O(1)).

Slow insertions/removals in the middle (O(n)).

Not thread-safe.


2. Vector
Synchronized Dynamic Array: Similar to ArrayList but thread-safe.

Underlying Data Structure: Array.

Best Use Case: When thread safety is required.

Key Features
Synchronized (thread-safe).

Slower than ArrayList due to synchronization overhead.

Legacy class (mostly replaced by ArrayList).


3. Stack
LIFO Data Structure: Extends Vector to implement a last-in-first-out stack.

Underlying Data Structure: Array.

Best Use Case: When LIFO behavior is required (e.g., undo operations, recursion).

Key Features
Inherits all methods from Vector.

Provides additional stack-specific methods:

push(E e): Adds an element to the top of the stack.

pop(): Removes and returns the top element.

peek(): Returns the top element without removing it.


4. LinkedList
Doubly-Linked List: Implements both List and Deque interfaces.

Underlying Data Structure: Doubly-linked list.

Best Use Case: When frequent insertions/removals are required.

Key Features
Fast insertions/removals (O(1)) at both ends.

Slow random access (O(n)).

Can be used as a list, queue, or deque.

When to Use Which?
ArrayList:

Use when frequent access to elements by index is required.

Example: Storing and accessing data in a list.

Vector:

Use when thread safety is required (rarely used in modern Java).

Example: Legacy applications.

Stack:

Use when LIFO behavior is required.

Example: Undo operations, recursion.

LinkedList:

Use when frequent insertions/removals are required.

Example: Implementing queues or deques.

Summary
List: Ordered collection with duplicate elements.

ArrayList: Fast random access, not thread-safe.

Vector: Thread-safe version of ArrayList.

Stack: LIFO data structure.

LinkedList: Fast insertions/removals, can be used as a list, queue, or deque.
