/**
 * Enum is a special "class" that represents a group of constants (unchangeable variables, like final variables).
 * You can use an enum when you have a fixed set of constants.
 * The enum constants are static and final implicitly.
 * The enum can be defined inside or outside the class.
 * The enum can have fields, constructors, and methods.
 * The enum can implement interfaces.
 * The enum can be used in switch statements.
 * The enum can be iterated.
