Enum in Java
An enum (short for enumeration) is a special data type that allows a variable to be a set of predefined constants. Enums are commonly used to represent a fixed set of related constants.

Key Features of Enum
Type Safety: Ensures that only valid constants can be assigned.

Readability: Improves code readability by using meaningful names.

Methods and Fields: Enums can have methods, fields, and constructors.

Implements Comparable and Serializable: Enums are comparable and serializable by default.


EnumSet
EnumSet is a specialized set implementation designed for use with enum types. It is highly efficient and provides type safety.

Key Features of EnumSet
High Performance: Backed by a bit vector, making it extremely fast.

Type Safety: Only allows elements of the specified enum type.

No Nulls: Does not allow null elements.

Not Thread-Safe: Requires external synchronization for thread safety.

EnumMap
EnumMap is a specialized map implementation designed for use with enum keys. It is highly efficient and provides type safety.

Key Features of EnumMap
High Performance: Backed by an array, making it extremely fast.

Type Safety: Only allows keys of the specified enum type.

No Null Keys: Does not allow null keys (but allows null values).

Not Thread-Safe: Requires external synchronization for thread safety.


Comparison of EnumSet and EnumMap
Feature	EnumSet	EnumMap
Purpose	Set of enum values	Map with enum keys
Underlying DS	Bit vector	Array
Null Elements	Not allowed	Null keys not allowed, null values allowed
Performance	Extremely fast	Extremely fast
Thread Safety	Not thread-safe	Not thread-safe
Use Case	Storing enum values	Storing key-value pairs with enum keys
When to Use Which?
Enum:

Use when you need a fixed set of related constants.

Example: Days of the week, status codes, etc.

EnumSet:

Use when you need a high-performance set of enum values.

Example: Storing a subset of enum constants.

EnumMap:

Use when you need a high-performance map with enum keys.

Example: Mapping enum constants to specific values or activities.

Summary
Enum: Represents a fixed set of constants.

EnumSet: High-performance set for enum values.

EnumMap: High-performance map for enum keys.
